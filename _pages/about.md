My name is Dongwoo Kim, an undergraduate student in Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology (GIST). \\
I major in computer science and minor in artificial intelligence. 

In my sophomore and junior, I was part of the core team of 1st GDSC (Google Developer Students Club) in GIST, where we provided undergraduate students with opportunities to get familiar with programming and to form a developer community. 

In 2022 spring semester, I participated in an exchange program, Berkeley Global Access (BGA) in U.C. Berkeley California. Besides U.C. Berkeley, I also have experience of exchange student in Boston University(2021 Summer Program), and Korea University(2021 Fall Semester). 

After returning from U.S. to South Korea, I worked as an intern at CJ Olivenetworks AI lab (2023.01~2023.02). During my winter internship, I worked on implementing artist-customed MIDI sample generator based on GPT2. Currently, I am studying Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (DDPM), especially in the usage of change detection. 


Along with Deep learning, I am also a big fan of hiphop music. :)
